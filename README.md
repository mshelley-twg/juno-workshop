The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Import Order
For consistency, when importing files, please group packages by:
* React
* External npm packages
* External components
* Common
* Core
* Relative CSS
* Relative JS

For readability, it may help to add a line break between groups.

Then, sort alphabetically by `from` path.

For example:

```js
// File: core/Profile/Profile.js

import React from 'react'
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button'
import ProgressBar from 'react-bootstrap/ProgressBar'

import { Card } from 'common/components'
import { Settings } from 'core/Settings'

import styles from './Profile.module.scss'
import { ProfileHeader } from './ProfileHeader'

// ...
```
